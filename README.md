# HtmlProject
This is the first repository with my first web app

I tried to structure this project in 3 principal folders:
CSS: Where you can find the .scss and the main estilos.css where all the styles are working together.
imgs: Where I put all the images that I used in the project.
javascript: Just a little function to help me to see how the html elements work with CSS and the grid of Bootstrap, it wont be working at the end of the project.

So trying to show the acomplished requieremnets, I'll continue in a list:

1. There are 4 pages in this first project: Index.html, Login.html, Foro.html and Noticias.html
All of them are coencted by the main banner in the page and the hidden menu in the mobile view.

2. You can fin the list in the index.html page, where the user can slide some topics about some games. A table in the page Foro, where i used to organice the satisfaction place of the page, of course this isnt working, it is just a view. and images are everywhere, I hope there no problem of copyright, I had no ideas sometimes about what kind of pictures to use.

3. the stylesheet is the same for all the pages, and it is the estilos.css 

4. The properties used were a lot, mainly I tried to learn so much a could about css, so you can look in the .scss files where I tried to organized the code by the element or the page.

5. The page use media querys to help me to organize the behavior of the head banner in the page, the picture "logo" and make it nice to the view.

6. I used a lot of the bootstrapp's grid to organiced the mobile responsive feature of the pages and the structure.

7. As yo can see in the CSS folder, there are scss files that converge in a main file (main.scss) that creates the estilos.css using SASS, which is the one inyected in the html code.
